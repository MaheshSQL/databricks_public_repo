# MAGIC #### Reliability Issues with Data Lakes

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - When a job fails, incomplete work is not rolled back, as it would be in a relational database.  Data may be left in an inconsistent state.  This issue is extremely difficult to deal with in production.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - Data lakes typically cannot enforce schema.  This is often touted as a "feature" called "schema-on-read," because it allows flexibility at data ingest time.  However, when downstream jobs fail trying to read corrupt data, we have a very difficult recovery problem.  It is often difficult just to find the source application that caused the problem... which makes fixing the problem even harder!
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - Relational databases allow multiple concurrent users, and ensure that each user gets a consistent view of data.  Half-completed transactions never show up in the result sets of other concurrent users.  This is not true in a typical data lake.  Therefore, it is almost impossible to have a concurrent mix of read jobs and write jobs.  This becomes an even bigger problem with streaming data, because streams typically don't pause to let other jobs run!
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC #### Performance Issues with Data Lakes
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC <img src="https://github.com/billkellett/flight-school-resources/blob/master/images/projects_failing_reasons_1.png?raw=true" width=1000/>
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - We have already noted that data lakes cannot provide a consistent view of data to concurrent users.  This is a reliability problem, but it is also a __*performance*__ problem because if we must run jobs one at a time, our production time window becomes extremely limited.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - Most data lake engineers have come face-to-face with the "small-file problem."  Data is typically ingested into a data lake in batches.  Each batch typically becomes a separate physical file in a directory that defines a table in the lake.  Over time, the number of physical files can grow to be very large.  When this happens, performance suffers because opening and closing these files is a time-consuming operation.  
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - Experienced relational database architects may be surprised to learn that Big Data usually cannot be indexed in the same way as relational databases.  The indexes become too large to be manageable and performant.  Instead, we "partition" data by putting it into sub-directories.  Each partition can represent a column (or a composite set of columns) in the table.  This lets us avoid scanning the entire data set... *if* our queries are based on the partition column.  However, in the real world, analysts are running a wide range of queries which may or may not be based on the partition column.  In these scenarios, there is no benefit to partitioning.  In addition, partitioning breaks down if we choose a partition column with extremely high cardinality.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - Data lakes typically live in cloud storage (e.g., S3 on AWS, ADLS on Azure), and these storage devices are quite slow compared to SSD disk drives.  Most data lakes have no capability to cache data on faster devices, and this fact has a major impact on performance.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC __*Delta Lake was built to solve these reliability and performance problems.*__  First, let's consider how Delta Lake addresses *reliability* issues...
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC <img src="https://github.com/billkellett/flight-school-resources/blob/master/images/delta_reliability.png?raw=true" width=1000/>
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Note the Key Features in the graphic above.  We'll be diving into all of these capabilities as we go through the Workshop:
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - __ACID Transactions:__ Delta Lake ACID compliance ensures that half-completed transactions are never persisted in the Lake, and concurrent users never see other users' in-flight transactions.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - __Mutations:__ Experienced relational database architects may be surprised to learn that most data lakes do not support updates and deletes.  These lakes concern themselves only with data ingest, which makes error correction and backfill very difficult.  In contrast, Delta Lake provides full support for Inserts, Updates, and Deletes.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - __Schema Enforcement:__ Delta Lake provides full support for schema enforcement at write time, greatly increasing data reliability.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - __Unified Batch and Streaming:__ Streaming data is becoming an essential capability for all enterprises.  We'll see how Delta Lake supports both batch and streaming modes, and in fact blurs the line between them, enabling architects to design systems that use both batch and streaming capabilities simultaneously.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - __Time Travel:__ unlike most data lakes, Delta Lake enables queries of data *as it existed* at a specific point in time.  This has important ramifications for reliability, error recovery, and synchronization with other systems, as we shall see later in this Workshop.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC We have seen how Delta Lake enhances reliability.  Next, let's see how Delta Lake optimizes __*performance*__...
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC <img src="https://github.com/billkellett/flight-school-resources/blob/master/images/delta_performance.png?raw=true" width=1000/>
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Again, we'll be diving into all these capabilities throughout the Workshop.  We'll be concentrating especially on features that are only available in Databricks' distribution of Delta Lake...
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - __Compaction:__ Delta Lake provides sophisticated capabilities to solve the "small-file problem" by compacting small files into larger units.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - __Caching:__ Delta Lake transparently caches data on the SSD drives of worker nodes in a Spark cluster, greatly improving performance.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - __Data Skipping:__ this Delta Lake feature goes far beyond the limits of mere partitioning.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC - __Z-Ordering:__ this is a brilliant alternative to traditional indexing, and further enhances Delta Lake performance.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Now that we have introduced the value proposition of Delta Lake, let's get a deeper understanding of the overall "Data Lake" concept.

# MAGIC ## Demo: Building a reliable data pipeline with Delta Lake
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC For this demo, we will use a public data set of loans from Lending Club. It includes all funded loans from 2012 to 2017. Each loan includes demographic information provided by the applicant, as well as the current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.) and latest payment information. For a full view of the data please view the data dictionary available [here](https://resources.lendingclub.com/LCDataDictionary.xlsx).

# MAGIC Now that our Silver table has been cleaned and conformed, and we've evolved the schema, the next step is to create a Gold table. Gold tables are often created to provide clean, reliable data for a specific business unit or use case.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC In our case, we'll create a Gold table that includes only 2 columns - `addr_state` and `count` - to provide an aggregated view of our data. For our purposes, this table will allow us to show what Delta Lake can do, but in practice a table like this could be used to feed a downstream reporting or BI tool that needs data formatted in a very specific way. Silver tables often feed multiple downstream Gold tables.

# MAGIC 3. Identify all of the rows that are not impacted by the insert or update
# MAGIC 4. Create a new temp based on all three insert statements
# MAGIC 5. Delete the original table (and all of those associated files)
# MAGIC 6. "Rename" the temp table back to the original table name
# MAGIC 7. Drop the temp table
